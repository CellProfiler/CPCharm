# Welcome to CPCharm!

## Repository content

_Modules folder:_   
CP-CHARM-specific modules that are not yet included in latest CellProfiler release. The use of these modules outside of CP-CHARM pipelines is not recommended before their inclusion in CellProfiler's official release.

_Pipelines folder:_   
Ready-to-use CellProfiler pipelines for extraction of the CHARM-like feature vector.

_Classifier folder:_   
Python scripts for training and testing a classifier, as well as for further label-free classification. Note that a proper Python installation as well as the following libraries is required:
   * Numpy (www.numpy.org/)
   * Scipy (www.scipy.org/)
   * Scikit-Learn (scikit-learn.org/)

_Example folder:_   
Application example of CP-CHARM. The folder contains:

* **Input_Images**, a folder containing images from a 2-class problem (Negative and Positive)
* **CHARM-like_training_data.csv** and **CHARM-like_training_labels.csv**, the feature vectors and corresponding labels for all images extracted using the `[TrainTestMode]CHARM-like` pipeline
* **pcalda_classifier.pk**, a pca-lda classifier trained and tested using 10-fold cross validation with the measurements from `CHARM-like_training_data.csv`
* **results_summary.txt**, a report of `pcalda_classifier.pk` training and testing phase
* **wnd_classifier.pk**, a WND classifier trained and tested using WND-CHARM's custom validation method with the measurements from `CHARM-like_training_data.csv`
* **predicted_labels.csv**, the output of blind classification of `Input_Images` using the previously trained and tested `pcalda_classifier.pk` classifier


## Setting up CP-CHARM-like

1) Download compiled version of CellProfiler

* Pipelines have been designed for two different CellProfile version, which can be downloaded at http://www.cellprofiler.org/previousReleases.shtml
    - **[TrainTestMode]CHARM-like.cp** and **[ClassifyMode]CHARM-like.cp** are designed for CellProfiler release version 2.0.11710
    - **[TrainTestMode]CHARM-like.cppipe** and **[ClassifyMode]CHARM-like.cppipe** are designed for CellProfiler release version 2.1.0

We advise to use the two pipelines designed with CellProfiler version 2.1.0, namely **[TrainTestMode]CHARM-like.cppipe** and **[ClassifyMode]CHARM-like.cppipe**.

We are currently updating the pipelines to CellProfiler's latest release, but in the meantime we recommend only using them with their native CellProfiler version.

2) Install modules specific to CP-CHARM

* Download the _Modules_ folder with all its content
* In CellProfiler's Preference menu, set up the plugin directory to point to your downloaded _Modules_ folder
* Note that you must restart CellProfiler after modifying the plugin directory path


## Running CP-CHARM-like

### Extracting features in CellProfiler
Two pipelines (per version) are available, located in the _Pipelines_ folder:
* **[TrainTestMode]CHARM-like** gathers metadata on filename (image ID), folder name (class), and eventual batch information (holdout), and outputs two `.csv` files: **CHARM-like_training_data.csv** and **CHARM-like_training_labels.csv**
	- **CHARM-like_training_data.csv** contains 954 columns (953 feature measurements plus a unique image identifier) and I+1 rows, where I is the total number of analysed images. The first row is composed of identifiers for each feature measurement (feature name) and the `Metadata_Key` field (indicating the column containing unique image identifiers).
	- **CHARM-like_training_labels.csv** contain 2 or 3 columns depending on the experiment and I+1 rows, where I is the total number of analysed images. The first row is always composed of the `Metadata_Key` (indicating the column containing unique image identifiers) and the `Metadata_Class` (indicating the column containing class labels) fields, and can also have a `Metadata_HoldOut` (indicating images from the same batch group) field.

* **[ClassifyMode]CHARM-like** gathers metadata on filename (image ID) only and outputs one `.csv` file: **CHARM-like_data.csv**

Note that the content of `Metadata_Key`, `Metadata_Class` and `Metadata_HoldOut` has to be adapted to the file naming system of the studied dataset by creating appropriate regular expressions in **LoadImages** (first module of the pipeline). `Metadata_Key` must contain strings that uniquely identify each image. `Metadata_Class` must contain the same string for all images of the same class, and be different for images of different classes. Finally, `Metadata_HoldOut` must contain similar identifiers for images coming from the same batch, which differ from identifiers of images from other batches.

In the training and testing phase, the fields `Metadata_Key` and `Metadata_Class` are mandatory to uniquely identify each image in the training set as well as its corresponding class. The field `Metadata_HoldOut` is not required if the `[HOLD OUT SAMPLES]` option is set to false (`0`) during classification. This field allows to ensure safe splitting of training and testing set to minimize batch effect during validation. In blind classification phase, only the `Metadata_Key` is required.

* For either pipeline, either open CP, load the **CHARM-like** pipeline you want and run analysis, or run CP headless (from CellProfiler directory) using the following command:

	    python CellProfiler.py -p ../CHARM-like.cp -c -r -o ../ -i ../Input_Images --plugins-directory=../Modules/

### Classifying using GUI
* Training and testing using **GUItraintest.py** script, located in the _Classifier_ folder
	- All required parameters are listed in the interface
	- Set parameters according to your needs, and then click the `OK` button

* Classifying using **GUIclassify.py**, located in the _Classifier_ folder
	- All required parameters are listed in the interface
	- Set parameters according to your needs, and then click the `OK` button

### Classifying in command-line
* Training and testing using **traintest.py** script, located in the _Classifier_ folder
	- Severals options are available using the following command line (from the _Classifier_ folder): 

		    python traintest.py [DATA_FILE (.csv)] [LABELS_FILE (.csv)] [OUTPUT_PATH] [NB_RUNS] [HOLD OUT SAMPLES (1:yes, 0:no)] [DISPLAY CONFUSION MATRIX (1:yes, 0:no)] [CLASSIFICATION_METHOD ("lda", "wnd")] [VALIDATION_METHOD ("save25", "kfold")] [NB_FOLDS (if VALIDATION_METHOD = "kfold")]

	- To run CP-CHARM-like with the default output from the **[TrainTestMode]CHARM-like.cppipe** CP pipeline, use:

		    python traintest.py ../CHARM-like_data.csv ../CHARM-like_labels.csv [OUTPUT_PATH] [NB_RUNS] [DISPLAY CONFUSION MATRIX (1:yes, 0:no)] "lda" "kfold" [NB_FOLDS]

	Where `[NB_RUNS]` is the number of times you would like the training/validation to repeated and `[NB_FOLDS]` is the number of folds in k-fold cross-validation. `[OUTPUT_PATH]` is the path to the directory here you would like the program to output the results (**results_summary.txt**) and the classifier (**wnd_classifier.pk** or **pcalda_classifier.pk**)
	
	- If one wants to save the confusion matrices in addition to the default `results_summary.txt` (which contains classification accuracies and the list of parameters used to do the experiment), `[DISPLAY CONFUSION MATRIX]` should be set to 1 and everything should be piped in a text file as in the following example:

		    python traintest.py ../CHARM-like_data.csv ../CHARM-like_labels.csv [OUTPUT_PATH] [NB_RUNS] 1 "lda" "kfold" [NB_FOLDS] > ../confusion_matrices.txt

	- Here's an example of a command that will run 10 rounds of 10-fold cross-validation using PCA-LDA and save the confusion matrices:

		    python traintest.py ../CHARM-like_data.csv ../CHARM-like_labels.csv ../ 10 1 "lda" "kfold" 10 > ../confusion_matrices.txt
	
	- Here's one that will run 100 rounds of "leave 25% out" validation using WND-CHARM without saving confusion matrices:
      
		    python traintest.py ../CHARM-like_data.csv ../CHARM-like_labels.csv ../ 100 0 "wnd" "save25"

* Classifying using **classify.py**, located in the _Classifier_ folder
	- Use the following command:

		    python classify.py [CLASSIFIER_FILE (.pk)] [DATA_FILE (.csv)] [OUTPUT_PATH]

	Where `[CLASSIFIER_FILE (.pk)]` is the classifier outputted by `traintest.py`, `[DATA_FILE (.csv)]` is the output feature file extracted using the `[ClassifyMode]CHARM-like.cppipe` pipeline, and `[OUTPUT_PATH]` is the path to the directory where the output **predicted_labels.csv** will be created.


## Notice

1) If images were acquired in several channels, either modify image loading in the **CHARM-like.cppipe** pipelines to handle multiple channels, or run the pipeline separately on either channels and concatenate the output files afterwards (custom scripts are available on demand for this)

2) Column headers names can be changed at will, the only requirement being to have 
   * In the data `.csv` file: a header containing the keyword **Key** (image labels)
   * In the label `.csv` file: a header containing the keyword **Key** (image labels), a header containing the keyword **Class** (class labels), and, if the `[HOLD OUT SAMPLES]` option is set to true (`1`) for classification, a header containing the keyword **HoldOut**
